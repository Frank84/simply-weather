# Assignment

Make an application that allows the user to browse the weather forecast for a given location, as well as weather information from up to 30 days ago.

The UI should use [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and communicate to the [Forecast.io API](https://developer.forecast.io/docs/v2) through a PHP backend.
